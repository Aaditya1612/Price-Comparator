# Price-Comparator
The project involves the development of a Price Comparator tool, allowing users to compare prices across various e-commerce sites. Python web scraping techniques are employed to gather data from different platforms. The scraping script is hosted using Django, creating an API. This API is seamlessly integrated into a Flutter web application, providing users with a user-friendly interface to efficiently compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions across multiple e-commerce platforms.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

1. **app/price_comparator**: Contains the Flutter web application.

2. **extractorapi**: Contains the Python Django scripts along with the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Application

### 1. Setting up the Django API (extractorapi)

1. Navigate to the `extractorapi` directory:

    ```bash
    cd extractorapi
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

   This will start the Django server on localhost.

### 2. Running the Flutter Web App (app/price_comparator)

1. Navigate to the `app/price_comparator` directory:

    ```bash
    cd app/price_comparator
    ```

2. Install the Flutter dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Open the `lib/pages/comparisonpage.dart` file and ensure that the URL variable is set to the Django API's localhost URL. Update the following line if necessary:

    ```dart
    // lib/pages/comparisonpage.dart
    String url = "http://localhost:8000/v1/fetch/?pname=";  // Update the localhost port as needed
    ```

4. Run the Flutter web application:

    ```bash
    flutter run -d web
    ```

   This will launch the web application locally.

### Accessing the Application

Visit the localhost port number where the web app has fired up in your web browser.
