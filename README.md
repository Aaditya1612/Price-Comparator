# Price-Comparator
The project involves the development of a Price Comparator tool, allowing users to compare prices across various e-commerce sites. Python web scraping techniques are employed to gather data from different platforms. The scraping script is hosted using Django, creating an API. This API is seamlessly integrated into a Flutter web application, providing users with a user-friendly interface to efficiently compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions across multiple e-commerce platforms.
